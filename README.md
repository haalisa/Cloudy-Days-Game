# Cloudy-Days-Game

# Start Menu

# Things to do here:
# Make clouds loop forever without crashing
# Add more clouds
# Make game load faster despite clouds
# Make clouds float/move smoother and perhaps a tad faster without compromising smoothness
# If we have time: settings/options, instructions, about us/end credits


# Level One

# Things to do here:
# Make scene function
# Have Kai lay on the bed
# Kit Kat is movable by wasd or arrow keys and can jump
# Collision detection works
# Interacting with the door will exit to the kitchen
# Make furniture interactive (i.e. clicking on the cat door will send Kit Kat to closet)
